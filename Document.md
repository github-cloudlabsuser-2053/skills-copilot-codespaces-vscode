# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow. The document also includes mermaid diagrams to visualize the application's structure and processes.

## Application Overview

The sample Node.js application is a RESTful API that allows users to manage tasks. It includes the following features:
- User authentication
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Error handling and logging

## Architecture

The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Below is a mermaid diagram illustrating the architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client -->|HTTP Requests| Controller
    Controller -->|Business Logic| Service
    Service -->|Database Queries| Model
    Model -->|Data| Database
    Database -->|Responses| Model
    Model -->|Processed Data| Service
    Service -->|Responses| Controller
    Controller -->|HTTP Responses| Client
```

## Workflow

The workflow of the application is as follows:
1. The client sends an HTTP request to the API.
2. The controller processes the request and calls the appropriate service.
3. The service interacts with the model to query or update the database.
4. The model communicates with the database and returns the data to the service.
5. The service processes the data and sends it back to the controller.
6. The controller sends the response to the client.

Below is a mermaid sequence diagram illustrating the workflow:

```mermaid

    participant Database

    Client->>Controller: HTTP Request
    Controller->>Service: Call Service
    Service->>Model: Query/Update Database
    Model->>Database: Execute Query
    Database->>Model: Return Data
    Model->>Service: Processed Data
    Service->>Controller: Response
    Controller->>Client: HTTP Response
```
